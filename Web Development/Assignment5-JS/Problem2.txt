Q.2 What are Web Apis ?
Ans:
Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other over the internet. They define a standardized way for different systems to exchange data and perform operations.

Web APIs are commonly used in web development to enable the integration of different services and applications. They allow developers to access and manipulate the functionality and data of a remote application or service using a well-defined interface. This enables the creation of more dynamic and interconnected web applications.
