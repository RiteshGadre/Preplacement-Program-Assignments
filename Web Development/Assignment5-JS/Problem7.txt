Q.7 Whatâ€™s async & await Keyword in JavaScript
Ans:
The async and await keywords in JavaScript provide a simplified syntax for handling asynchronous code. 

- async is used to declare an asynchronous function that returns a promise.
- await is used inside an async function to pause execution and wait for a promise to resolve before proceeding.
- await can only be used within an async function and returns the resolved value of the promise.
- It helps in writing asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner, resembling synchronous code.
- Error handling is done using try-catch blocks around the await expressions.
