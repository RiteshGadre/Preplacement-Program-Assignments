Q.1 Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?
Ans:
Synchronous Programming:
- Tasks are executed one after the other in a sequential manner.
- The program waits for a task to complete before moving on to the next task.
- Execution is blocking, meaning that other tasks have to wait for the current task to finish.
- The program follows a predictable and linear flow.

Asynchronous Programming:
- Tasks are initiated but don't block the program's execution.
- The program can continue executing other tasks without waiting for the completion of a specific task.
- Execution is non-blocking, allowing concurrent execution of multiple tasks.
- Callback functions, promises, or async/await are used to handle the results or errors of asynchronous tasks.
- The program flow may not follow a strict linear sequence, as tasks may complete in different orders.
